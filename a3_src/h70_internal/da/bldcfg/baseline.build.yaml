  # Set TRUE to limit design standards verification checks to files and
  # modules which have changed. This is appropriate for testing scenarios
  # where fast feedback is given priority over comprehensive test coverage.

  # and FALSE for baseline and release builds.

  # testing where we need to surface failures as soon as we can.

  # Set TRUE to wait until the end of each phase before deciding whether or
  # not the build should be aborted. This is appropriate for root cause
