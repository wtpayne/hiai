  identification:
    _num: "1.1"
    _req: >
      This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the system
      and the software to which this document applies, including, as
      applicable, identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s),
      version number(s), and release number(s).

      This document is the base HiAi software development plan. It
      defines the default text for software development plans used
      across the organisation.

      When the documentation for a specific system is generated, then
      for each section where no system specific tailoring is provided,
      default text originating from this document will be used instead.

      This document is therefore not directly applicable to any specific
      system.

      The documentation for each system shall be generated whenever a
      baseline build or release build is made, and shall be available
      alongside the other build artifacts.

      An authoritative version of the documentation shall be supplied
      with each system baseline or release. Each document shall identify
      the configuration for which it is applicable.

    _req: >
      This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system and
      the software to which this document applies.

      It shall:

      a. describe the general nature of the system and software;

      b. summarize the history of system development, operation,
         and maintenance;

      c. identify the project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and
         support organizations;

         and

      d. identify current and planned operating and user sites.

      This SDP documents how the software will be designed, developed,
      integrated, tested and managed. It identifies applicable policies,
      requirements and standards for development. It defines schedules,
      organisation, resources and processes to be followed.

      This document follows the outline of a software development plan
      contained in the MIL-STD-498 data item description for an SDP:
      DI-IPSC-8127. Once complete, it also meets the content requirements
      for IEEE/EIA 12207.1 development plan (paragraph 6.5) and project
      management plan (paragraph 6.11). This SDP is organized as follows:

      - Section 2 lists all documents referenced by this SDP and
        used during its preparation.
      - Section 3 provides an overview of the required work.
      - Section 4 describes plans for general software development
        activities.
      - Section 5 describes the details of all software planning,
        design, development, engineering, integration, test,
        evaluation, Software Configuration Management (SCM), product
        evaluation, Software Quality Assurance (SQA), and preparation
        for delivery activities.
      - Section 6 defines the project schedule and activity network.
      - Section 7 describes the project organization and the resources
        required to accomplish the work.

      This document should be considered confidential to authorised
      recipients, governed by the appropriate nondisclosure agreement,
      but is otherwise not subject to any further security or privacy
      considerations.

    _num: "1.4"
    _req: >
      This paragraph shall describe the relationship, if any, of the SDP
      to other project management plans.
    _txt: >
      This SDP and its companion documents, the software configuration
      management Plan (SCMP) and the software quality assurance plan
      (SQAP), serve as the guiding documents to develop the software.
