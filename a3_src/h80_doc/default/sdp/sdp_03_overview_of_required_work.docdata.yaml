    Overview of required work. This section shall be divided into paragraphs
    as needed to establish the context for the planning described in later
    sections. It shall include, as applicable, an overview of:

    a. Requirements and constraints on the system and software to be
       developed,

    b. Requirements and constraints on project documentation;

    c. Position of the project in the system lifecycle;

    d. The selected project and acquisition strategy;

    e. Any requirements or constraints on the selected project and
       acquisition strategy;

    f. Requirements and constraints on project schedules and resources;

    and

    g. Other requirements and constraints, such as on project security,
       privacy, methods, standards, interdependencies on hardware and
       software development.

    Development activities in this plan are subject to the following
    requirements.

system_and_software_development_requirements_and_constraints:
  _num: "3.1"
  _req: >
    NONE
  _txt: >
    The system and software development process shall be tailored
    to meet time-to-market reqirements. The development effort will
    tolerate increased technical risk and permit the accrual of
    technical debt to meet time-to-market constraints. High risk
    design elements shall be identified for later rework.

project_documentation_requirements_and_constraints:
  _num: "3.2"
  _req: >
    NONE
  _txt: >
    There do not exist any external requirements or constraints on
    project documentation. The quantity and form of documentation is
    left to the discretion of the project team.

    When discretionary documentation is developed, then the project
    may choose to adopt and tailor templates from either the SMC-S-012
    or from MIL-STD-498.

    Both of these standards are comprehensive and detailed, and even
    a partial implementation of the documentation specified by these
    standards should suffice for most needs.

    The project is at the beginning of the project life-cycle.

    To meet time-to-market constraints, work-packages suitable for
    subcontracting shall be identified and specified.
