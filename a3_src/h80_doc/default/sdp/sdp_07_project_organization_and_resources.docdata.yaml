        This paragraph shall show the contractual and intracorporation

        to the software team member that required the product.

        This paragraph shall be organized by internal software team member
        receiver with the prime contractor relationships first.

        If a single software team member has multiple sites performing
        software-related efforts on this project, then each organization
        site shall be treated separately. For each internal receiver-giver
        pair, this paragraph shall identify each software item, and other
        software, produced by the internal giver for the internal receiver.

        This paragraph shall include for each receiver-giver software team
        member relationship:
