      - "Work through errors; Get dependency registry
        back up and running. Still need to refine
        build monitor class so we get a UI display
        back again. Also need to figure out how we
        can test the build monitor class. Also
        need to figure out a way of getting a more
        readable and uniform error and nonconformity
        report at the CLI."
