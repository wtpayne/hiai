    - "At the moment, the build is explicitly design-document
      centric. The main loop iterates over each design document
      in turn and runs static analysis and unit testing on it.
      In reality, we want to be able to run tests if either the
      test document or the original changes. We also possibly
      may want to handle different aggregates of design files
      or entities that are not source files. This task is to
      explore the possiblity of using a different and more
      abstract build unit concept within the main build loop."

      - "Increase test coverage to 100% of public function calls."
      - "We have added checking code to halt the build if we do not
        have sufficient coverage. Now we need to gradually work our
        way through each error adding (possibly dummy) tests as
        needed. The real test code will be added later later when
        start to check the LOC coverage given by our tests."
