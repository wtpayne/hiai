title:
  "Coordinate Systems Register."

introduction:
  "Clear definition of reference directions, coordinate systems and their
  inter-relationships is a key part of any systems engineering process.

  A non-trivial system will involve the definition of dozens of coordinate
  systems for various purposes. Each needs to be rapidly and clearly defined
  and communicated.

  This registry assists in this process by providing a central list of
  (abstract) coordinate system definitions, each of which may be rapidly
  selected and specialised for a particular component, subsystem or platform."

  x00_aph:
    name:
      "Focal plane array physical coordinate system."
    mnemonic:
      "aph"
    description:
      "This coordinate system is intended to represent the position of
      mechanical and optical components relative to the geometric centre
      of the focal plane array."
    definition:
      "This coordinate system is physical, cartesian, right-handed and three
      dimensional.

      The origin is located at the geometric centre of the photosensitive
      (active) part of the focal plane array. It sits in front of all of the
      electronic components, but behind any transparent protective covering
      (glass layer).

      The x axis runs parallel to the rows of pixels on the focal plane array;
      its positive direction extends towards the right hand side of the camera.

      The positive direction of the y axis runs vertically upwards towards the
      top of the camera.

      The z axis completes the right-handed triad: It is oriented orthogonally
      to the plane of the focal plane array, and the positive direction extends
      towards the rear of the camera."


  x01_arc:
    name:
      "Focal plane array row-column coordinate system."
    mnemonic:
      "arc"
    description:
      "This coordinate system addresses pixels across the entirety of the
      focal plane array pixel grid, and is intended to be used for reasoning
      about rolling shutter line-readout timing; vignette and fixed pattern
      electronic interference.

      All pixels physically present in the focal plane array are taken into
      consideration; including those that are not part of the active read-out
      area. It is not a physical coordinate system, so the fine physical
      arrangement of pixels is not taken into consideration and negative and
      non-integral values are not meaningful."
    definition:
      "This coordinate system is logical, cartesian, right-handed and two
      dimensional.

      The origin sits at the extreme top left hand corner of the (entire)
      physical pixel grid.

      The positive direction of the first 'R' axis (row) extends downwards,
      incrementing by one for each row of pixels.

      The positive direction of the second 'C' axis (col) extends rightwards,
      incrementing by one for each column of pixels passed."


  x02_irc:
    name:
      "Image row-column coordinate system."
    mnemonic:
      "irc"
    description:
      "This coordinate system addresses pixels in the active, image-forming
      portion of the focal plane array pixel grid.

      Only pixels present in the image are taken into consideration. It is
      not a physical coordinate system, so the fine physical arrangement of
      pixels is not taken into consideration and negative and non-integral
      values are not meaningful."
    definition:
      "This coordinate system is logical, cartesian, right-handed and two
      dimensional.

      The origin sits at the extreme top left hand corner of the pixel grid
      from which the current image was formed.

      The positive direction of the first 'R' axis (row) extends downwards,
      incrementing by one for each row of pixels.

      The positive direction of the second 'C' axis (col) extends rightwards,
      incrementing by one for each column of pixels passed."


  x03_ixy:
    name:
      "Image optical-axis centric coordinate system."
    mnemonic:
      "ixy"
    description:
      "This is a hybrid coordinate system used as a half-way house when
      converting from a (logical) image row-column coordinate system to
      a physical sensor-centric coordinate system.

      The only calibration information required for conversion to this
      system is the IXY row and column of the pixel closest to the point
      where optical axis intersects the focal plane array.

      It is not a physical coordinate system, so the fine physical arrangement
      of pixels is not taken into consideration and non-integral values are
      not meaningful."
    definition:
      "This coordinate system is logical, cartesian, right-handed and two
      dimensional.

      The origin sits at the pixel closest to the point at which the primary
      optical axis intersects the pixel grid.

      The positive direction of the x axis extends rightwards in the same
      direction as the 'C' axis of x02_irc.

      The positive direction of the y axis extends upwards in the
      opposite direction to the 'R' axis of x02_irc."


  x04_oea:
    name:
      "Optoelectronic subsystem aligned coordinate system."
    mnemonic:
      "oea"
    description:
      "This is a physical coordinate system used to represent real-world
      bearings relative to the Optoelectronic subsystem. (i.e. the optics
      and the focal plane array considered together as a single unit.)"
    definition:
      "This coordinate system is physical, cartesian, right-handed and three
      dimensional.

      The origin sits at the point at which the primary optical axis
      intersects the focal plane array.

      The z axis is aligned in the opposite direction to the primary optical
      axis, with the positive direction extending towards the rear of the
      camera.

      The x axis is oriented parallel to the rows of pixels in the focal
      plane array, with the positive direction extending towards the right
      hand side of the camera.

    name:
      "Camera mechanical assembly aligned coordinate system."
    mnemonic:
      "mea"
    description:
      "This is a physical coordinate system used to represent real-world
      bearings relative to the camera mechanical assembly. (i.e. the parts
      connecting and containing the optical and electronic components of the
      camera).

      The camera intrinsic calibration should provde sufficient information
      for converting between x02_irc (row, col) values and x05_mea (x, y, z)
      values.

      The difference between the x05_mea coordinate system and the x04_oea
      coordinate system is a measure of the misalignment of the optical and
      optoelectronic conponents. If the lens and the focal plane array are
      perfectly aligned and centered then the two coordinate systems should
      be identical."

    definition:
      "This coordinate system is physical, cartesian, right-handed and three
      dimensional.

      The origin sits at the point at which the primary optical axis
      intersects the focal plane array.

      The z axis is oriented along the nominal primary optical axis, with the

      The x axis is oriented parallel to the nominal orientation of the rows
      of pixels in the focal plane array, with the positive direction extending
      towards the right hand side of the camera.

      The y axis completes the right-handed-triad with the positive direction

      bearings relative to a sensor mounted on a platform (i.e. a moving
      object - vehicle or appendage - to which the sensor is rigidly
      attatched). It is related to the body frame of the platform by

  x10_ticks:
    name:
      "Internal monotonic clock ticks."
    mnemonic:
      "ticks"
    description:
      "This is a free-running, unsynchronised internal system clock,
      monotonically counting the number of 'ticks' since the previous
      system start or reset. It is a purely internal clock-counter; not
      synchronised or adjusted. This means that it is guaranteed to always
      be available and to count monotonically upwards at a steady rate;
      but not guaranteed to be free from drift nor to bear any particular
      relationship with external time standards (UTC etc).

      This value is intended to be used to calculate small time deltas
      accurately rather than to be used for absolute time values or for
      synchronisation.

      To preserve data-flow semantics, this clock is not directly accessible
      at the application layer. Instead, messages are timestamped as they are
      recieved into the system. For a particular data-flow node, the effective
      'current' time is obtained by looking at the highest clock-counter value
      recieved by that node (taking wrapping into consideration).

      The tick frequency will vary from system to system."

    definition:
      "This coordinate system is physical and one dimensional.

      Following system start or reset, the first possible value is zero.
      Subsequent ticks occur at fixed intervals and increment the value
      by one."


  x11_utc:
    name:
      "External global UTC time."
    mnemonic:
      "utc"
    description:
      "This is a global timestamp, synchronised with an external time
      source. It is intended to be used for synchronisation with external
      events and data sources.


      It is not guaranteed to be always available (due to the reliance on
      an external time source), but when it is available it will be synchronised
      is guaranteed to be synchronised with a global time source. (e.g. GPS
      time).

      If it is not synchronised, it is zero.

      To preserve data-flow semantics, this clock is not directly
      accessible at the application layer. Instead, messages are timestamped
      as they are recieved into the system. For a particular data-flow node,
      the effective 'current' time is obtained by looking at the highest
      timestamp value recieved by that node (taking wrapping into
      consideration)."

    definition:

  x12_msg_num:
    name:
      "System message number."
    mnemonic:
      "msg_num"
    description:
      "This is a non-negative integral value that represents the order in
      which messages (of any type) were recieved by the application layer
      of the system or subsystem under consideration.

      The first message recieved after system start or reset is assigned
      message number zero. The value assigned increments by one for each
      subsequent message.

      This is an application-layer concept. Corrupt messages rejected by
      transmission protocols before they enter the application layer boundary
      of the system under consideration should not be counted.

      This value is intended to be used to sequence replay of recorded
      data streams through a (Khan) data flow network to support resimulation
      for systems development and verification.

      For practical work, this value will be represented by a finite
      precision unsigned integer and the value can be expected to wrap
      periodically."

    definition:
      "This coordinate system is logical and one dimensional.

      Following system start or reset, the first message crossing the system
      boundary at the application layer is assigned message number zero.
      Subsequent messages are assigned incrementally increasing message
      numbers."
