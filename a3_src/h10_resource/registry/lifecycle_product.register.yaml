  "Lifecycle product register."


introduction:
  "This registry contains a definitive list of engineering lifecycle products
  and provides a mapping between individual lifecycle products and lifecycle
  product classes. In this manner the registry facilitates the systematic and
  universal application of class specific registration, validation and
  tracking processes."
