build:
  def:  "A process whereby a set of build output artifacts are generated
        in accordance with a design configuration, and where the design
        configuration is specified by a set of consistent and conformant
        design documents."

  def:  "An item that has been generated as the result of the operation of
        a build process. This is normally a digital file such as a binary

design_configuration:
  def:  "The term 'design configuration' is defined as a set of design
        decisions which collectively specify one or more designs. A design
        configuration is represented by a set of design documents, and is
        identified by the git SHA-1 digest for the relevant repository
        revision. Any act which changes a design should also result in a
        change to the design configuration."

design_decision:
  def:  "A decision made in the course of creating a design. The
        granularity and impact of design decisions can vary wildly.
        Some design decisions play a key role in safety or performance,
        and are documented and tracked as part of the development process.
        A design decision may be represented by one or more design elements
        contained within one or more design documents."

design_element:
  def:  "The representation of a part of a design which is sufficiently
        compact and small for it to be considered as if it were an
        irreducible atom. Design elements live at the level of individual
        parameter values; expressions; control constructs and small one or
        two line functions."
